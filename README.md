Your objective is to score as many points as possible, you receive 1 point by getting a cart(C) on the dock(D), when the dock has been loaded with 8 carts you get another 10 points. But watch out because if two carts collide you lose and if the last 8 spots(X) of the dead track are filled up you also lose.
